# Spinning Top Simulation with Linear Friction Damping in MATLAB

This project is a simulation of a spinning top in MATLAB that includes linear friction damping to model the effects of friction on the top's motion. The simulation uses Euler angles to calculate the top's orientation and rotational motion.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, simply download or clone the repository and open the "main.m" file in MATLAB. Input the desired initial conditions, such as the top's mass, moment of inertia, and initial angular velocity. The simulation will then calculate the top's motion over time and output visualizations of its orientation and angular velocity.

## Simulation Details

The simulation is based on the equations of motion for a spinning top, which take into account the top's mass, moment of inertia, and angular velocity. In addition, linear friction damping is included in the simulation to model the effects of friction on the top's motion. The amount of damping is proportional to the top's angular velocity, and can be adjusted to simulate different levels of friction.

Euler angles are used to represent the top's orientation in three-dimensional space. The simulation calculates the top's orientation as it spins, and uses this information to update the top's angular velocity and position over time.

## Output Visualizations

The simulation outputs visualizations of the top's orientation and angular velocity over time. These visualizations can be used to gain insights into the behavior of spinning tops and the effects of friction on their motion. The output includes plots of the top's orientation as a function of time, as well as its angular velocity.

## Applications

This simulation has a variety of potential applications, including in the study of gyroscopic stabilization in engineering applications, the design and optimization of spinning top toys, and the education of physics students on the principles of rotational motion and friction. The MATLAB code can be easily modified to simulate different initial conditions and levels of friction damping, making it a versatile tool for exploring the behavior of spinning tops.
